        subject: Failed to deliver mail to %{domain} registrant
        body: |
          Dear %{sender}!

          We were unfortunately unable to forward your message to the registrant of the %{domain}.
          We started a proceeding to fix the contact data of the domain registrant and forwarded your message
          to the admin contacts of the domain - hopefully they are able to help you.

          If you have any further questions, please contact the Estonian Internet Foundation at info@internet.ee or +372 727 1000.

          We are sorry for the inconvenience.
